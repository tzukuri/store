SpreeDynamicVariants
====================

This Gems creates variants for a Spree/Solidus Shop when needed.
Useful for products with many, many options.
Dynamic Variant Creation is a better alternative than creating multimillion variant entries for each possible option combination.

Adds a "dynamic variants" checkbox to products which makes the variant creation for the product dynamic.
Adds a surcharge field to option values which contains optional surcharges for a specific option value.

dynamic variant creation:
- Shows all available options as dropdowns in product screen.
- When product is put in cart, the correct variant is created if it doesn't exist yet.
- The variant will have the price of the product plus the surcharges of its selected option values
- Existence of a products variant is checked by options and price (if the price is altered a new variant will be created).


Installation
------------
Add spree_dynamic_variants to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_dynamic_variants', github: 'hefan/spree_dynamic_variants', branch: 'master'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_dynamic_variants:install
```


Setup
-----
Add Products, Option Types and Option Values.
Assign Surcharges for Option Values if needed.
Assign Option Types to Product.
Set "dynamic variants?" on Product to true.

Go to Frontend Product Screen, assemble your Options and put it in Cart.

Caveats
-------
Assumes the Variant will be combined and sent after ordering (or is digital).
Therefore: If track inventory is on, the newly created variant will have track_inventory = false.
The newly created variant will have the same sku like the master variant plus a timestamp.

When you create Orders in Backend you still need to create the variant by hand.


Testing
-------
First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_dynamic_variants/factories'
```
